# LeetCode Hero

> _From Zero to Leetcode Hero_

Welcome to LeetCode Hero, a repository that documents my _journey of mastering algorithms_ and data structures. This project serves as both a personal learning journal and a professional portfolio of my solutions, implemented in Modern C++ and Haskell.

- ⭐ Star this repository if you find it helpful!
- 🔄 Share with others learning functional programming
- 🤝 Contributions welcome - especially Haskell optimizations!

## My Approach

- **Modern C++:** Solutions in C++ are written to reflect clean, efficient, and production-ready code, mirroring my professional work as a compiler engineer.
- **Haskell:** Solutions in Haskell are an exploration of functional programming paradigms, used to tackle problems from a different perspective and for mental training.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is contained in its own directory, named with its LeetCode number and title for easy navigation (e.g., `001_Two_Sum`). Explanations are added for some solutions as I refine my understanding.

## About Me

Feel free to check out my other projects on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/TheCloudlet).

# LeetCode 心法練習 SOP

## A. 解題前 (Pre-computation Checklist)

- [ ] 靜坐 1-2 分鐘，專注於呼吸，穩定心神。
- [ ] 讀誦或默念以下動機設定：
  > 願我能在此次練習中保持耐心與平靜。\
  > 無論解出與否，願我能從中學到新的知識。\
  > 這不僅是為了面試，也是一次鍛鍊我心智韌性的機會。

## B. 解題中 (Runtime Debugging)

### 當卡關、挫折感升起時 (Exception Handling: Frustration)

- **觸發條件**：想了十分鐘還是沒頭緒、程式碼一直出錯、看到 test case 沒過。
- **除錯程序**：
  - [ ] **暫停 (Pause)**：立刻停止打字，雙手離開鍵盤。
  - [ ] **返回錨點 (Return to Anchor)**：做一次有意識的深呼吸，感受氣息與身體。
  - [ ] **標記念頭 (Label the Thought)**：在心中為升起的念頭貼上標籤。「*一個『我很笨』的念頭出現了*」、「*一個『焦慮』的感覺升起了*」。
  - [ ] **認知分離 (Decoupling)**：認知到你正在「觀察」這個念頭，而非「是」這個念頭。
  - [ ] **重新出發 (Resume)**：帶著更清明的心，重新審視問題。

### 當解出題目、沾沾自喜時 (Handling Success Signals)

- **觸發條件**：「Accepted!」的綠色字樣出現。
- **除錯程序**：
  - [ ] **覺察喜悅**：體會那份開心的感覺，並用正念觀察它。
  - [ ] **標記念頭**：「*一個『我很強』的念頭出現了*」。
  - [ ] **認知分離**：理解這份喜悅也是無常的、因緣和合的（來自過去的積累與當下的狀態），避免陷入「我執」。

## C. 解題後 (Post-mortem Review)

- [ ] **心念覆盤 (Mental Log Review)**：花一分鐘回想並回答：
  1. 這次最讓你卡關的，是技術瓶頸，還是心理波動？
  1. 在哪個時間點最想放棄？當時是什麼念頭在主導？
  1. 你有沒有成功地使用「暫停呼吸」或「標記念頭」的工具？
- [ ] **感恩作結 (Gratitude)**：感謝自己今天花時間進行了這次「雙重練習」（演算法 + 心法），為練習畫上一個積極的句點。

## Progress Tracker

This section tracks my progress through various topics and concepts. This blueprint defines the cultivation path to Google (supervised by Sister).

### Phase 1: The Diagnostic (The Awareness Pass)

This step is non-negotiable. We must see the truth first.

- **Task:** Build and complete the `CultivationDB.yaml` database.
- **Requirement:** Log all original 61 problems (from the legacy `ls.log`).
  - [x] All 61 problems logged.
- **Core Mission:** Honestly tag every problem as `L1_FORGOT`, `L2_STRUGGLE`, or `L3_MASTERED`.
- **Key Challenge (Psychological Nudity):** The `refinement_focus` field *must* be filled out. This forces the admission of weakness and is the cure for the "I feel awful" panic.

______________________________________________________________________

### Phase 2: The Triage (The "Debt List") - \[PRIORITY: ACTIVE\]

This is the task we discussed on Sept 6-7. Phase 1 (Diagnosis) revealed a clear "Debt List" of forgotten critical topics. This is your immediate homework.

- **Mission:** Attack the **L1_FORGOT List**. Treat these 10 problems as "new" and re-learn them from scratch.

- **Goal:** Convert all 10 of these from `L1` to at least `L2_STRUGGLE` by mid-September.

- **The Debt List (The 7 "L1_FORGOT" entries from YAML):**

  - [x] `211` (Design Add/Search Trie) - (Trie Data Structure)
  - [x] `207` (Course Schedule I) - (Kahn's / Topological Sort)
  - [x] `210` (Course Schedule II) - (Graph Cycle Check)
  - [x] `152` (Max Product Subarray)
  - [x] `155` (Min Stack)
  - [x] `239` (Sliding Window Max) - (Monotonic Queue)
  - [x] `416` (Partition Equal Subset Sum) - (Knapsack DP)

- **The 2 Missing Problems (The "New Debt"):**

  - [ ] `004` (Median of Two Sorted Arrays) - (Hard Binary Search)
  - [ ] `556` (Next Greater Element III)
  - [ ] `918` Maximum Sum Circular Subarray (kadane's algorithm variant)

______________________________________________________________________

### Phase 3: The Integration - Mindful Mastery

**Mission:** To systematically clear foundational weaknesses and the `L2_STRUGGLE` list by merging deliberate practice with the mindfulness techniques defined in the "LeetCode 心法練習 SOP". The goal is not just to solve problems, but to achieve a state of calm, focused flow while doing so.

**The Weekly Ritual:**

- [ ] Dedicate each week to a specific theme.
- [ ] For every practice session, begin with the `A. 解題前 (Pre-computation Checklist)`.
- [ ] When facing difficulty or success, apply the `B. 解題中 (Runtime Debugging)` techniques.
- [ ] End each session with the `C. 解題後 (Post-mortem Review)`.

**Topic Mastery Checklist:**

- [ ] **Theme: Linked List**
  - [ ] Complete all Neetcode 150 Linked List problems (0/13)
  - [ ] Review all `L2_STRUGGLE` Linked List problems from `CultivationDB.yaml`
- [ ] **Theme: Trees (Basics & Traversal)**
  - [.] Complete core Neetcode 150 Tree problems (e.g., Traversal, Max Depth, Same Tree, Subtree) (4/7)
- [ ] **Theme: Trees (Advanced)**
  - [ ] Complete advanced Neetcode 150 Tree problems (e.g., Level Order, BST, Tries) (0/7)
- [ ] **Theme: DP / Graphs / etc.**
  - [ ] Systematically work through other `L2_STRUGGLE` topics from `CultivationDB.yaml`
- [ ] **Theme: System Design (Introduction)**
  - [ ] Watch/Read 2-3 introductory pieces of content on System Design per week (e.g., foundational concepts, classic problem overviews). (0/10)

______________________________________________________________________

### Phase 4: The Synthesis - Holistic Interview Prep

**Prerequisite:** This phase begins when the `L2_STRUGGLE` list feels manageable and you have built confidence in the core topics from Phase 3. The focus shifts from topic-by-topic learning to integrated, mock-interview-style practice.

**Mission:** To synthesize all required skills—algorithmic fluency, system design, and behavioral communication—into a cohesive, interview-ready whole.

**The Three Pillars of Preparation:**

- **Pillar 1: Algorithmic Fluency**

  - [ ] Conduct full-length (45 min) mock coding interviews (0/5)
  - [ ] Review all `L3_MASTERED` problems to ensure instant recall (0/20)
  - [ ] Tackle a curated list of `Hard` problems to expand boundaries (0/5)

- **Pillar 2: System Design**

  - [ ] Study and summarize foundational System Design concepts (e.g., CAP Theorem, Caching, Load Balancing, Databases) (0/5)
  - [ ] Practice explaining the architecture of classic problems aloud (e.g., Design Twitter, Design a URL Shortener, Design a Web Crawler) (0/5)
  - [ ] Conduct full-length (45 min) mock System Design interviews (0/3)

- **Pillar 3: Behavioral & Communication**

  - [ ] Draft and refine 5-7 key project stories using the STAR method.
  - [ ] Practice telling your stories aloud, focusing on clarity and impact.
  - [ ] Prepare thoughtful questions to ask your interviewers.
  - [ ] Review your "About Me" and professional narrative from your resume.
