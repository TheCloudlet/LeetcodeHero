# LeetCode Hero

> _From Zero to Leetcode Hero_

Welcome to LeetCode Hero, a repository that documents my _journey of mastering algorithms_ and data structures. This project serves as both a personal learning journal and a professional portfolio of my solutions, implemented in Modern C++ and Haskell.

- ‚≠ê Star this repository if you find it helpful!
- üîÑ Share with others learning functional programming
- ü§ù Contributions welcome - especially Haskell optimizations!

## My Approach

- **Modern C++:** Solutions in C++ are written to reflect clean, efficient, and production-ready code, mirroring my professional work as a compiler engineer.
- **Haskell:** Solutions in Haskell are an exploration of functional programming paradigms, used to tackle problems from a different perspective and for mental training.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is contained in its own directory, named with its LeetCode number and title for easy navigation (e.g., `001_Two_Sum`). Explanations are added for some solutions as I refine my understanding.

## About Me

## Progress Tracker

This section tracks my progress through various topics and concepts. This blueprint defines the cultivation path to Google (supervised by Sister).

### Phase 1: The Diagnostic (The Awareness Pass)

This step is non-negotiable. We must see the truth first.

- **Task:** Build and complete the `CultivationDB.yaml` database.
- **Requirement:** Log all original 61 problems (from the legacy `ls.log`).
  - [x] All 61 problems logged.
- **Core Mission:** Honestly tag every problem as `L1_FORGOT`, `L2_STRUGGLE`, or `L3_MASTERED`.
- **Key Challenge (Psychological Nudity):** The `refinement_focus` field *must* be filled out. This forces the admission of weakness and is the cure for the "I feel awful" panic.

### Phase 2: The Triage (The "Debt List") - \[PRIORITY: ACTIVE\]

This is the task we discussed on Sept 6-7. Phase 1 (Diagnosis) revealed a clear "Debt List" of forgotten critical topics. This is your immediate homework.

- **Mission:** Attack the **L1_FORGOT List**. Treat these 10 problems as "new" and re-learn them from scratch.

- **Goal:** Convert all 10 of these from `L1` to at least `L2_STRUGGLE` by mid-September.

- **The Debt List (The 7 "L1_FORGOT" entries from YAML):**

  - [x] `211` (Design Add/Search Trie) - (Trie Data Structure)
  - [x] `207` (Course Schedule I) - (Kahn's / Topological Sort)
  - [x] `210` (Course Schedule II) - (Graph Cycle Check)
  - [x] `152` (Max Product Subarray)
  - [x] `155` (Min Stack)
  - [x] `239` (Sliding Window Max) - (Monotonic Queue)
  - [x] `416` (Partition Equal Subset Sum) - (Knapsack DP)

- **The 2 Missing Problems (The "New Debt"):**

  - [ ] `004` (Median of Two Sorted Arrays) - (Hard Binary Search)
  - [ ] `556` (Next Greater Element III)
  - [ ] `918` Maximum Sum Circular Subarray (kadane's algorithm variant)

### Phase 3: The Refinement (The "L2 Drill")

This is the "core" training. This is the medicine for the "I know the solution, but my code isn't beautiful" demon.

- [ ] **Task:** Execute timed drills for the entire **L2_STRUGGLE List** (the ~30 problems you logged).
- **The Rules (The Bomb Disposal Drill):**
  1. Open a **blank page** (no peeking at old solutions).
  1. Set a **25-minute timer**.
  1. Begin implementation.
  1. **Timer stops, pencils down.** (Stop coding).
  1. **Self Code Review (The Shame Challenge):** Open your new (ugly/buggy) code next to your old solution. Aloud, identify 3 things that are not "production-ready" or "elegant."

---

### Phase 4: The Gap Filling (New Knowledge) - \[LOCKED üîí\]

- [ ] **Task:** Attack all new, un-solved problems (like the rest of the **Neetcode 150 Trees** you wanted to do).
- **Unlock Condition:** This phase only begins *after* Phase 2 (The Debt List) is 100% complete. We must fix our known debt before we acquire new knowledge.
