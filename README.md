# LeetCode Hero

> _From Zero to Leetcode Hero_

Welcome to LeetCode Hero, a repository that documents my _journey of mastering algorithms_ and data structures. This project serves as both a personal learning journal and a professional portfolio of my solutions, implemented in Modern C++ and Haskell.

- ‚≠ê Star this repository if you find it helpful!
- üîÑ Share with others learning functional programming
- ü§ù Contributions welcome - especially Haskell optimizations!

## My Approach
- **Modern C++:** Solutions in C++ are written to reflect clean, efficient, and production-ready code, mirroring my professional work as a compiler engineer.
- **Haskell:** Solutions in Haskell are an exploration of functional programming paradigms, used to tackle problems from a different perspective and for mental training.

## Repository Structure
Each problem is contained in its own directory, named with its LeetCode number and title for easy navigation (e.g., `001_Two_Sum`). Explanations are added for some solutions as I refine my understanding.

## Progress Tracker
This section tracks my progress through various topics and concepts.
