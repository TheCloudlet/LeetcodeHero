# LeetCode Hero

> _From Zero to Leetcode Hero_

Welcome to LeetCode Hero, a repository that documents my _journey of mastering algorithms_ and data structures. This project serves as both a personal learning journal and a professional portfolio of my solutions, implemented in Modern C++ and Haskell.

- ‚≠ê Star this repository if you find it helpful!
- üîÑ Share with others learning functional programming
- ü§ù Contributions welcome - especially Haskell optimizations!

## My Approach

- **Modern C++:** Solutions in C++ are written to reflect clean, efficient, and production-ready code, mirroring my professional work as a compiler engineer.
- **Haskell:** Solutions in Haskell are an exploration of functional programming paradigms, used to tackle problems from a different perspective and for mental training.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is contained in its own directory, named with its LeetCode number and title for easy navigation (e.g., `001_Two_Sum`). Explanations are added for some solutions as I refine my understanding.

## About Me

Feel free to check out my other projects on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/TheCloudlet).

## Progress Tracker

### Phase 1: The Diagnostic (The Awareness Pass)

- [x] Build and complete the `CultivationDB.yaml` database.
______________________________________________________________________

### Phase 2: The Triage (The "Debt List") - \[PRIORITY: ACTIVE\]

This is the task we discussed on Sept 6-7. Phase 1 (Diagnosis) revealed a clear "Debt List" of forgotten critical topics. This is your immediate homework.

- **Mission:** Attack the **L1_FORGOT List**. Treat these 10 problems as "new" and re-learn them from scratch.

- **Goal:** Convert all 10 of these from `L1` to at least `L2_STRUGGLE` by mid-September.

- **The Debt List (The 7 "L1_FORGOT" entries from YAML):**

  - [x] `211` (Design Add/Search Trie) - (Trie Data Structure)
  - [x] `207` (Course Schedule I) - (Kahn's / Topological Sort)
  - [x] `210` (Course Schedule II) - (Graph Cycle Check)
  - [x] `152` (Max Product Subarray)
  - [x] `155` (Min Stack)
  - [x] `239` (Sliding Window Max) - (Monotonic Queue)
  - [x] `416` (Partition Equal Subset Sum) - (Knapsack DP)
  - [x] `230` (Kth Smallest Element in a BST)
  - [ ] `206` (Reverse Linked List)

- **The 2 Missing Problems (The "New Debt"):**

  - [ ] `004` (Median of Two Sorted Arrays) - (Hard Binary Search)
  - [ ] `556` (Next Greater Element III)
  - [ ] `918` Maximum Sum Circular Subarray (kadane's algorithm variant)

### Phase 3: The Integration - Mindful Mastery

**Mission:** To systematically clear foundational weaknesses and the `L2_STRUGGLE` list by merging deliberate practice with the mindfulness techniques defined in the "LeetCode ÂøÉÊ≥ïÁ∑¥Áøí SOP". The goal is not just to solve problems, but to achieve a state of calm, focused flow while doing so.

**Topic Mastery Checklist:**

- [ ] **Theme: Linked List**
  - [ ] Complete all Neetcode 150 Linked List problems (3/13)
  - [ ] Review all `L2_STRUGGLE` Linked List problems from `CultivationDB.yaml`
- [x] **Theme: Trees (Basics & Traversal)** (6/6)
- [x] **Theme: Trees (Advanced)** (9/9)
- [ ] **Theme: DP / Graphs / etc.**
  - [ ] Systematically work through other `L2_STRUGGLE` topics from `CultivationDB.yaml`
- [ ] **Theme: System Design (Introduction)**
  - [ ] Watch/Read 2-3 introductory pieces of content on System Design per week (e.g., foundational concepts, classic problem overviews). (0/10)
- [ ] Interval Tree

### Phase 4: The Synthesis - Holistic Interview Prep

**Prerequisite:** This phase begins when the `L2_STRUGGLE` list feels manageable and you have built confidence in the core topics from Phase 3. The focus shifts from topic-by-topic learning to integrated, mock-interview-style practice.

**Mission:** To synthesize all required skills‚Äîalgorithmic fluency, system design, and behavioral communication‚Äîinto a cohesive, interview-ready whole.

**The Three Pillars of Preparation:**

- **Pillar 1: Algorithmic Fluency**

  - [ ] Conduct full-length (45 min) mock coding interviews (0/5)
  - [ ] Review all `L3_MASTERED` problems to ensure instant recall (0/20)
  - [ ] Tackle a curated list of `Hard` problems to expand boundaries (0/5)

- **Pillar 2: System Design**

  - [ ] Study and summarize foundational System Design concepts (e.g., CAP Theorem, Caching, Load Balancing, Databases) (0/5)
  - [ ] Practice explaining the architecture of classic problems aloud (e.g., Design Twitter, Design a URL Shortener, Design a Web Crawler) (0/5)
  - [ ] Conduct full-length (45 min) mock System Design interviews (0/3)

- **Pillar 3: Behavioral & Communication**

  - [ ] Draft and refine 5-7 key project stories using the STAR method.
  - [ ] Practice telling your stories aloud, focusing on clarity and impact.
  - [ ] Prepare thoughtful questions to ask your interviewers.
  - [ ] Review your "About Me" and professional narrative from your resume.
