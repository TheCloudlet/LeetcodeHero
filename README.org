_From Zero to Leetcode Hero_
#+end_quote

Welcome to LeetCode Hero, a repository that documents my *journey of mastering algorithms* and data structures. This project serves as both a personal learning journal and a professional portfolio of my solutions, implemented in Modern C++ and Haskell.

- ‚≠ê Star this repository if you find it helpful!
- üîÑ Share with others learning functional programming
- ü§ù Contributions welcome - especially Haskell optimizations!

** My Approach
- *Modern C++:* Solutions in C++ are written to reflect clean, efficient, and production-ready code, mirroring my professional work as a compiler engineer.
- *Haskell:* Solutions in Haskell are an exploration of functional programming paradigms, used to tackle problems from a different perspective and for mental training.

** Repository Structure
Each problem is contained in its own directory, named with its LeetCode number and title for easy navigation (e.g., =001_Two_Sum=). Explanations are added for some solutions as I refine my understanding.

** Progress Tracker
This section tracks my progress through various topics and concepts.

** About Me
