# How to practice Leetcode

## QRH for solving leetcode problems

### Pre-practice Checklist

- [ ] 1. Set clear goals

  - Define clear, measurable objectives for your practice session.
  - Examples: "Practice 3 medium sliding window problems" or "Simulate contest conditions"

- [ ] 2. Select appropriate problems

  - Not too easy (already mastered), not too hard (completely lost)
  - Choose based on: weak patterns, contest preparation, or spaced repetition review

- [ ] 3. Breathe 7 times

  - Deep, calming breaths to center yourself

- [ ] 4. Read the following intention
     > 願我能在此次練習中保持耐心與平靜。 \
     > 無論解出與否，願我能從中學到新的知識。 \
     > 這不僅是為了面試，也是一次鍛鍊我心智韌性的機會。

## During-practice

### Problem-Solving Process

- [ ] 1. **Read & Understand** (2-3 mins)

  - Read problem statement carefully
  - Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints
  - Clarify edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates, etc.)
  - Verify understanding with given examples

- [ ] 2. **Think Before Coding** (3-5 mins for Medium/Hard)

  - Identify problem pattern (two pointers, sliding window, DP, graph, etc.)
  - Consider brute force approach first
  - Think of optimizations
  - Sketch out algorithm/pseudocode

- [ ] 3. **Analyze Complexity** (1-2 mins)

  - Determine time complexity of your approach
  - Determine space complexity of your approach
  - Confirm if it meets problem constraints

- [ ] 4. **Code the Solution**

  - Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
  - Add comments for complex logic
  - Start timer for coding phase

- [ ] 5. **Test & Debug**
  - Test with provided examples
  - Test edge cases (empty, single element, max size, etc.)
  - Dry run through your code mentally
  - Fix any bugs found

### Time Tracking

- **If you solve independently:**

  - Time from reading problem to starting code, e.g., 15 minutes
  - Time from writing code to passing all test cases, e.g., 5 minutes
  - Final record format: **Pass 15 + 5**

- **If you cannot solve independently:**

  - Time from reading problem to getting stuck, usually less than 30 minutes, e.g., 25 minutes
  - Time to read solution, understand, and code to pass test cases, e.g., 20 minutes
  - Final record format: **Failed 25 + 20**

- **Time limit rules:**
  - Maximum 1 hour per problem, exceeding means cannot solve independently
  - If cannot come up with a solution within 30 minutes, read the editorial
  - Easy: Target completion within 15 minutes
  - Medium: Target completion within 25-30 minutes
  - Hard: Target completion within 45 minutes (or read editorial)

## Post-practice Checklist

- [ ] 1. **Verify Solution Quality**

  - Code is accepted on Leetcode
  - Time complexity is optimal (or justify if not)
  - Space complexity is optimal (or justify if not)
  - Code is clean and readable

- [ ] 2. **Explore Alternative Approaches**

  - Think of at least two different approaches
  - Compare trade-offs (time vs space, code complexity, etc.)
  - Read top solutions in discussion section if stuck

- [ ] 3. **Document & Reflect**

  - Record the problem pattern/category (e.g., "Sliding Window", "DP - Knapsack")
  - Note key insights or tricks learned
  - Document mistakes made and why
  - Add to personal pattern library

- [ ] 4. **Follow-up Questions** (Optional but recommended)

  - What if constraints change? (larger N, different data types)
  - What if we need to optimize for space instead of time?
  - Can this be extended to 2D or more dimensions?
  - Related problems to practice?

- [ ] 5. **Spaced Repetition Schedule**

  - Add to review queue for 3 days later
  - Add to review queue for 7 days later
  - Mark difficulty level for future reference

- [ ] 6. **Time Analysis** (If failed)
  - Where did you get stuck? (understanding, algorithm, implementation, debugging)
  - What knowledge gap prevented you from solving?
  - What pattern should you review?

### Pattern-Based Learning

When building foundation or addressing weak areas:

- [ ] **Identify Weak Patterns**

  - Track which pattern types you struggle with (DP, Graph, Tree, etc.)
  - Use Leetcode pattern lists or study guides

- [ ] **Focused Practice Sessions**

  - Practice 3-5 problems of the same pattern in one session
  - Start with Easy, progress to Medium, then Hard
  - Note common variations and edge cases

- [ ] **Contest Simulation**
  - Do weekly contest practice (90 mins, 4 problems)
  - Simulate real contest conditions (no hints, time pressure)
  - Review missed problems immediately after

### Learning from Editorials

When you can't solve a problem:

- [ ] Read editorial/solution carefully
- [ ] Understand the key insight that you missed
- [ ] Code it yourself WITHOUT looking at the solution
- [ ] Explain the solution out loud or in writing
- [ ] Mark for review in 3 days (should solve independently)
