| 1     | Doesn't know how to analyze the problem; cannot understand even with multiple hints.  | Didn't write any code.                                                                        | Thinking process is chaotic; unable to communicate.                                                           |
| 2     | Understands the problem somewhat after hints; can provide an initial idea.            | Code significantly deviates from the correct solution or unable to translate ideas into code. | Can communicate own understanding simply, but cannot effectively communicate with the interviewer.            |
| 3     | Can provide a brute-force solution; can provide a suboptimal solution after hints.    | Code style and structure have issues; code has bugs but didn't check for them.                | Can express own thought process relatively clearly, but lacks interaction with the interviewer.               |
| 4     | Can provide a suboptimal solution; can provide the optimal solution after hints.      | Code logic has no major issues, but has some minor problems in details.                       | Clearly expresses own thought process; has some discussion about the problem with the interviewer .           |
| 5     | Can provide multiple solutions and analyze the pros and cons of different approaches. | Code has good naming, clear structure, core logic has comments.                               | Clearly expresses own thought process; engages in in-depth discussion about the problem with the interviewer. |

### Check Point

If we meet the following criteria, we consider that we have achieved the goal:

1. Can identify common problem patterns (sliding window, two pointers, DP, graph traversal, etc.) within 2-3 minutes.
2. Solve medium-difficulty problems in under 20 minutes with optimal solution.
3. 90% of the time you know the time and space complexity of your solution.
4. Successfully solve 3 problems in Leetcode weekly contest for 3 consecutive weeks.
5. Leetcode weekly contest rating 2000~2200.
6. Review and understand editorial solutions for unsolved contest problems within 24 hours of each contest.
